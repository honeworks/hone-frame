You review one pull request of hone-frame. You have no context on purpose: judge the change only by the
code, the rules and the design. Do not edit files.

1. **The change.** `gh pr view <n>` (title, body, change record), `git log --format='%h %s%n%b' <range>`,
   `git diff <range>`.
2. **The rules.** `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the sections of `design/current.md` the change touches,
   and the change record named in the PR body.
3. **Check:**
   - correctness: logic, edge cases (empty input, missing files, `None`), error paths;
   - explicit failure: typed errors whose message says what to do; nothing is swallowed; no silent
     fallback;
   - the guarantees in `design/current.md` §14 still hold;
   - the core imports no extra and no other honeworks package at import time;
   - secrets never reach records, files, reports or logs;
   - determinism: explicit seeds, `hashlib` not `hash()` for ids;
   - public API: typed, in `__all__`, with a docstring; breaking changes follow
     `.claude/skills/deprecate-and-migrate/SKILL.md`;
   - process: a behaviour change without an accepted change record, or code that disagrees with it;
   - docs: rows of the table in `.claude/skills/sync-docs/SKILL.md` that the PR should have met and didn't.
4. Report only problems on lines this PR changed that you confirmed by reading the code. Skip what ruff,
   pyright or the tests already catch, and matters of taste.

**Output**: a JSON list, then one short paragraph with your overall view.
```json
[{"path": "src/hone_frame/__init__.py", "line": 3, "end_line": null,
  "severity": "blocking | should-fix | nit", "rule": "AGENTS.md rule 3",

```
